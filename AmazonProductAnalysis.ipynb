      "I’m obsessed with SUGAR’s Matte As Hell Crayon Lipstick in 15 Stephanie Plum (Plum Mauve)! This bold mauve-plum shade is my go-to for everything from work to nights out—it’s vibrant yet classy and flatters my medium Indian skin tone perfectly. The 2.8g crayon applies like a dream, giving full-coverage color in one swipe that lasts 8+ hours without fading. Its creamy, hydrating formula keeps my lips soft, and the silky matte finish feels luxe. The included sharpener ensures precise application, and the smudge-proof wear survives coffee and chats! Packaged in a chic black case, it’s a steal at Rs. 849 for such stunning quality!\n",
      "\n",
      "Review 2:\n",
      "👎👎👎Really disappointed with this purchase from Sugar. The product arrived damaged, and there’s no option for return or replacement, which is incredibly frustrating. I expected better quality control and customer support from such a well-known brand. It’s unacceptable to pay full price and receive a broken item with no way to fix the issue. Definitely rethinking future purchases from Sugar after this experience\n",

      "Review 6:\n",
      "Got this product as a free gift and my first time using crayon. The shade is perfect for medium to dark skin tone. And gives adecent coverage. Smooth texture - glides so easily. didn't expect that from a crayon. Didn't dry out. And stayed throughout the day. Good quality product and is worth the pice point. No sharpner with it, but that can be overseen for this rate.\n",

      "Review 8:\n",
      "This is a free lipstick that I received when I bought one sugar lipstick. The colour is very beautiful but the lipstick is totally smudging and is washable. Quality wise the lipstick even if it is free it is a complete waste. Also this lipstick that is free comes with the only quantity that I have marked in the image but don't know why they mention the price is 386 for a free lipstick.\n"

      "I’m obsessed with SUGAR’s Matte As Hell Crayon Lipstick in 15 Stephanie Plum (Plum Mauve)! This bold mauve-plum shade is my go-to for everything from work to nights out—it’s vibrant yet classy and flatters my medium Indian skin tone perfectly. The 2.8g crayon applies like a dream, giving full-coverage color in one swipe that lasts 8+ hours without fading. Its creamy, hydrating formula keeps my lips soft, and the silky matte finish feels luxe. The included sharpener ensures precise application, and the smudge-proof wear survives coffee and chats! Packaged in a chic black case, it’s a steal at Rs. 849 for such stunning quality!\n",

      "👎👎👎Really disappointed with this purchase from Sugar. The product arrived damaged, and there’s no option for return or replacement, which is incredibly frustrating. I expected better quality control and customer support from such a well-known brand. It’s unacceptable to pay full price and receive a broken item with no way to fix the issue. Definitely rethinking future purchases from Sugar after this experience\n",

      "Got this product as a free gift and my first time using crayon. The shade is perfect for medium to dark skin tone. And gives adecent coverage. Smooth texture - glides so easily. didn't expect that from a crayon. Didn't dry out. And stayed throughout the day. Good quality product and is worth the pice point. No sharpner with it, but that can be overseen for this rate.\n",

      "This is a free lipstick that I received when I bought one sugar lipstick. The colour is very beautiful but the lipstick is totally smudging and is washable. Quality wise the lipstick even if it is free it is a complete waste. Also this lipstick that is free comes with the only quantity that I have marked in the image but don't know why they mention the price is 386 for a free lipstick.\n",
